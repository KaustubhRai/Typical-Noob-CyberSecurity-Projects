Overview: 
    Implement popular encryption algorithms like AES, DES, RSA, etc. to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Steps:
    Choose a programming language (e.g., Python).
    Use libraries or frameworks that support cryptographic operations.
    Build a simple user interface to input, encrypt, decrypt, and display messages.

Starting with caesar cypher, will make encrypt/decrypt commands for a cli thing then move onto making it for web

all the algorithms we will tackle:
    caesar - done
    Substitution Cipher - done
    Vigenère Cipher - done
    Transposition Cipher
    DES (Data Encryption Standard) 
    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) 
    RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
    Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
